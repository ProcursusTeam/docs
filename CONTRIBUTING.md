# Contributing to the Documentation

Pull requests are welcomed with open arms, but they must meet a specific criteria in order for them to be considered "valid"

Pull requests will be categorized under two categories

- Wanted changes: Changes which generally fix grammatical errors, add new documentation, or otherwise provide an improvement to the existing docs
- Unwanted changes: Changes which are unnecessarily complex, changing the complete structure, wording, and layout of the docs

## For maintainers

Pull requests should only be processed in one way: Squash and merge.

Pull requests should always be merged with the "Squash and Merge" option. The usage of other options is discouraged, and specific branch protections have been added to prevent you from doing things like merge commits.
